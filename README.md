# performance measures for Machine learning algorithm
This repo demonstrates how to evaluate the performance of a model via Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1 Score metrics in ML and provides a brief explanation of the “Confusion Metrics”. In this experiment, I have used Two-class Boosted Decision Tree Algorithm and my goal is to predict the survival of the passengers on the Titanic.

Once you have built your model, the most important question that arises is how good is your model? So, evaluating your model is the most important task in the data science project which delineates how good your predictions are.


Once you understand these four parameters then we can calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score.

Accuracy - Accuracy is the most intuitive performance measure and it is simply a ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations. One may think that, if we have high accuracy then our model is best. Yes, accuracy is a great measure but only when you have symmetric datasets where values of false positive and false negatives are almost same. Therefore, you have to look at other parameters to evaluate the performance of your model. For our model, we have got 0.803 which means our model is approx. 80% accurate.

Accuracy = TP+TN/TP+FP+FN+TN

Precision - Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. The question that this metric answer is of all passengers that labeled as survived, how many actually survived? High precision relates to the low false positive rate. We have got 0.788 precision which is pretty good.

Precision = TP/TP+FP

Recall (Sensitivity) - Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class - yes. The question recall answers is: Of all the passengers that truly survived, how many did we label? We have got recall of 0.631 which is good for this model as it’s above 0.5.

Recall = TP/TP+FN

F1 score - F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. Intuitively it is not as easy to understand as accuracy, but F1 is usually more useful than accuracy, especially if you have an uneven class distribution. Accuracy works best if false positives and false negatives have similar cost. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different, it’s better to look at both Precision and Recall. In our case, F1 score is 0.701.

F1 Score = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)


# When to Use ROC vs. Precision-Recall Curves?
Generally, the use of ROC curves and precision-recall curves are as follows:

ROC curves should be used when there are roughly equal numbers of observations for each class.
Precision-Recall curves should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance.
The reason for this recommendation is that ROC curves present an optimistic picture of the model on datasets with a class imbalance.
